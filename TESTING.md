# Testing Guide

## Purpose
This project is a plain PHP gallery CMS without a formal browser automation stack. The most reliable testing approach is a mix of fast syntax checks, focused script-level checks, and a repeatable manual smoke-test scenario that exercises the core gallery lifecycle.

## Test Layers

### 1. Syntax Checks
Use these first when touching PHP or JavaScript:

```bash
php -l path/to/file.php
```

For JavaScript, use whatever local parser or linter is available in your environment. Syntax checks catch obvious breakage, but they do not prove the app still behaves correctly.

### 2. Script-Level Tests
The repository uses current direct PHP regression tests under `tests/`. Run the complete isolated suite with:

```bash
php tests/run.php
```

Run one focused test directly when diagnosing a failure:

```bash
php tests/gallery_visibility_model_test.php
php tests/browser_upload_settings_test.php
php tests/gallery_public_paths_test.php
php tests/migration_consistency_test.php
php tests/thumbnail_warmup_model_test.php
```

The favorite shortcut test covers zero configured shortcuts, direct gallery links, the optional main-page shortcut, duplicate/missing-gallery cleanup, public visibility filtering, and HTML escaping.
The gallery dates test covers manual date range normalization, reversed-range rejection, public display formatting with en dash separators, rendered date attributes, and branch matching used by scoped EXIF suggestion reviews.
The gallery public-path test covers Czech transliteration, decomposed accents, invisible Unicode characters, HTML entities, hierarchical paths, and sibling slug collisions.
The migration consistency test validates every migration definition and proves that old schema_migrations rows remain harmless after obsolete migration files are removed.

These tests are maintained against the current namespaced production code. They are best for pure logic, helper functions, and regression checks that do not require a browser session. A release patch should not be published while `php tests/run.php` reports a failure.

### 3. Manual Functional Smoke Tests
For feature work, use the same end-to-end scenario every time. Keep one dedicated test installation or local database so you can create and remove test content freely.

Recommended flow:

1. Log in as admin.
2. Open the dashboard and confirm it renders without errors.
3. Create a new gallery.
4. Edit gallery title, description, manual date range, visibility, tags, and ordering settings.
5. Upload 2 to 3 images.
6. Open the gallery on the public site.
7. Open an image in the lightbox.
8. Reorder images if the change touches ordering.
9. Open an existing gallery that contains photos with EXIF dates, use **Apply to this gallery**, and confirm the From/To fields update without a full page reload when JavaScript is enabled. Repeat from any side-panel editor entry point that exposes the same component. Then confirm the gallery card displays the resulting branch range with the en dash separator.
10. Open **Review branch suggestions** for a parent gallery and confirm the table only lists that gallery and its subgalleries.
11. Open Admin **Gallery dates** after scanning images with EXIF dates, then apply one suggestion and confirm the gallery card displays the resulting date range.
12. Rename or move the gallery if the change touches file or path logic. Confirm the public URL uses lowercase ASCII slugs, contains no encoded spaces or diacritics, and still resolves after moving the gallery under another parent.
13. Create a gallery named **Testovací fotky** with a child named **Test nahrání** and confirm the child URL is `/gallery/testovaci-fotky/test-nahrani/`.
14. Delete the test gallery and confirm cleanup succeeds.

## What To Retest After A Change

### Low-Risk Changes
For CSS, text, layout polish, or small UI tweaks, test the affected page and one nearby page.

### Medium-Risk Changes
For controllers, forms, admin tools, or display logic, retest the touched feature plus the main gallery browse flow.

### High-Risk Changes
For routing, permissions, uploads, deletes, renames, migrations, public media serving, or feature flags, retest:

- admin login
- gallery create/edit/delete
- photo upload and public rendering
- lightbox and navigation
- any route or tool the change can disable
- schema migration or install flow, if database code changed

## Practical Rule
Ask these questions before and after the change:

- Can an admin still manage galleries?
- Can visitors still browse public galleries?
- Can media still upload, render, and delete?
- Did I touch a route, permission check, or database schema?

If the answer is yes to any of those, run the manual smoke test in addition to syntax checks.

## Recommended Habit
Keep a short test note for each significant change:

- what changed
- what you tested
- what you did not test
- any warning signs or follow-up work

That makes regressions easier to track and helps future changes focus on the highest-risk paths first.
